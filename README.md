# HW5-TriviaGame

My start function seems to be on an infinite loop and it freezes my page so although everything was working and I have no errors I'm unable to make sure the game works, which doesn't allow me to style it as I would like.

Any tips on what I did wrong? I feel like I did everything right, and this game should work...
